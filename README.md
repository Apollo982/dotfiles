# dotfiles
Just the dotfiles for my personal Catppuccin Mocha Hyprland rice + 

![An image of the complete rice. At the top of the screen, there are 3 separate panels. Just below the leftmost one is a window of a terminal emulator showcasing hardware specs. Towards the right of the screen is a small music player playing Rollin' Girl by Wowaka from the album Unhappy Refrain, also containing a monochrome audio visualizer. Just below that is another, longer audio visualizer, this one being a pastel rainbow. Behind all of this is a wallpaper showing a geometric heart on a dark background.](https://github.com/Apollo982/dotfiles/blob/main/assets/Rice.png)
