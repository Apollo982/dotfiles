Main Things
* OS: Arch Linux
* WM: [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/) (Dotfiles by me)
* Launcher: [Rofi-Wayland](https://github.com/A417ya/rofi-wayland) (both [@keyitdev's dotfiles](https://www.github.com/keyitdev/dotfiles) and [Newmand Sanchez](https://github.com/newmanls)'d [Spotlight theme](https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection/blob/master/themes/spotlight.rasi) are included, both with some small changes to align them with the [Catppuccin Port](https://github.com/catppuccin/rofi)
* Terminal: Kitty ([Catppuccin Port](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty))
* Bar: Waybar (Mainly from from @elifouts's [dotfiles](https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles) 
* Shell: zsh
* Notifications: SwayNC ([Catppuccin Port](https://github.com/catppuccin/swaync)
* System Info View: [Macchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina) (I think I got the dotfiles from somewhere, but I can't remember where. I'll update this once I find out)
* Browser: Zen Browser (w/ [Natsumi Browser](https://github.com/greeeen-dev/natsumi-browser) and the [Catppuccin Port](https://github.com/catppuccin/zen-browser))

Other Things, may or may not be included
* Audio Visualizer: [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava)([Catppuccin Port](https://github.com/catppuccin/cava))
* Music Player: [Kew](https://github.com/ravachol/kew)(Default Configuratiion)
If any configs arent included, then I am likely using a defauly Catppuccin Port
